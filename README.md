# Human-Following-Trolley

This was our Group Project

The Human Following Trolley project focuses on developing an intelligent robotic trolley capable of autonomously following a human user in a shopping environment. This interdisciplinary endeavor integrates principles from mechanical, electronic, and computer engineering to enhance the shopping experience through automation. The project addresses the problem of improving convenience and efficiency in shopping centers by reducing the physical burden on shoppers, particularly the elderly and disabled. The trolley utilizes advanced sensors, including ultrasonic and RFID systems, to detect and track the user's movements accurately. Software simulations and hardware implementations were conducted to validate the design and functionality of the trolley. The project also explores various conceptual designs and identifies an optimal solution through rigorous testing and analysis. Future enhancements include incorporating barcode scanning for product information and wireless charging capabilities. This report encapsulates the methodology, design, implementation, and potential improvements of the Human Following Trolley, providing a comprehensive overview of its development and applications.
